# CRGAN

This is the official PyTorch implementation of "Abnormal Event Detection via Context-conditional Region-level Generative Adversarial Network" (MM 2020). This repository allows you to test the CRGAN models and visualize the predictions. The training code and dataset will come soon after the paper is accepted!
